OpenFOAM-Docs-Webpages (ODW) is a Hugo module leveraging the great [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) Hugo theme and [FoamCD](https://github.com/FoamScience/ODW) to generate stunning and actually useful documentation pages which stay up-to-date with minimal effort.

It's for the lazy lots of us who write OpenFOAM code frequently and want to document it in a way that's actually decent to look at and browse. Reading source code files is still better though...

The core idea is to eventually put emphasis, not only the C++ features a code base leverages, but on more important Domain-Specific Language features, especially for OpenFOAM, MPI and friends. Right now, the project is in its first phases. Any PRs are appreciated. And don't hesitate to report issues you may encounter!
