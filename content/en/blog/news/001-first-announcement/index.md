linkTitle: Announcing ODW
description: >
  The Docsy Hugo theme lets project maintainers and contributors focus on content,
  not on reinventing a website infrastructure from scratch; FoamCD generates most of that content
  automatically for you directly from your code base!

Initial work on the companion website project for documenting the design and implementation
of my PhD project (Meshless methods in CFD applications) has been completed. The project
is in a stable state hence made available for the wide public to use. As always, all kinds of PRs are
very much welcome!
